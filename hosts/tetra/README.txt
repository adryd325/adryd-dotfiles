What is this?

tetra is a battery powered Raspberry Pi with an SDR. It's used to listen to the TTC's TETRA frequencies while on the train and headless.
It creates a wireless access point to connect using a phone and control SDR software, and listen to the audio stream with the device in my backpack.
(it looks like a bomb which is why I keep it in my backpack: https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/840041918003281932/957804847858597948/IMG_3539.jpg)

Setup script assumes you're using Rasperry Pi OS 11 64bit with a desktop environment.
